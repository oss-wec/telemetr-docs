# Introduction

telemetR is a modularized wildlife telemetry data management system. At the core of the system is a database and API that can be used to develop tools to analyze animal movement data. Each module of telemetR is developed independently and can be used independently. I like to think of telemetR as a set of legos bricks. Each brick is a different module, and can be recombined in different configurations to work for your needs.

Contributions are always welcome. If you have ideas for new modules, or additions to existing modules check GitHub or send me an email.
